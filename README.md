# Intro-Quant-Trading
Applications from the StackSkills course "Quant Trading Using Machine Learning" by instructor Loonycorn.

This repo will not contain many files immediately as I am working through materials from the course.<br>
I hope to push my own work to this repository in the future.

Please find my course schedule (gsheet) here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jhzwb3XN_meW3avneGPBYdFomzBoYktUbqGJpdBboIQ/edit?usp=sharing <br>
In order for the "Goal Setting" formulas to work, you will need to enable Scripts. <Br>
This is Gsheet's versions of VBA editor, except it is in Javascript rather than Visual Basic.<br>
You can find a .txt file in this repo with the simple 'mintohrs' function I wrote.
